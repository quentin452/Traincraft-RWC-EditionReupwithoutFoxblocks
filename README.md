This is the custom Traincraft version use on the RailwayCraft (RWC) server. It has some features not in the latest standard Traincraft version, but also doesn't have some feature from the standard Traincraft added yet either.

 

Disclaimer: I am not a dev of Traincraft or the custom RWC port of it, I am only reposted and will be keeping this page up to date with the latest RWC Traincraft versions for those you want to use that in their modpacks instead of the standard one, of course still abiding by standard Traincraft's Tos. (https://github.com/Spitfire4466/Traincraft-164/blob/master/LICENSE.md). You will also find this version more server friendly and less buggy since it was made for a server.
